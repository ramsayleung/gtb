* Your mom ask you to go to bed
** About The Project
*** Motivation
    Honestly speaking, I am not a night owl, and I don't want to be. But sometimes I am too much focus on my work or project to forget bedtime, so I want a tool to notify me when it's time to sleep. Thus, I built this tool. 

    It will detect any keyboard event at the bedtime, then print a message to console every 10 seconds. You can customize the interval seconds, bedtime and notification message.

    You could also use this tool to notify you to go off work.
** Getting Started
*** Prerequisites
    + Python 3.6+(for the fstring feature)
    + [[https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard][keyboard]]:
      #+begin_src sh
	sudo pip install keyboard
      #+end_src
*** Installation
    Clone the repo:
    #+begin_src sh
      git clone git@github.com:ramsayleung/gtb.git
    #+end_src
** Usage
   Running in the background on Linux
   #+begin_src sh
     cd gtb
     sudo python main.py&
   #+end_src

   Important:

   **You need to run this tool with =sudo=, since the =keyboard= dependency requires sudo privilege to hook global keyboard event.**

   For more options:
   #+begin_src sh
     > sudo python main.py -h

     usage: main.py [-h] [-g GO_TO_BED_HOUR] [-w WAKE_UP_HOUR] [-i INTERVAL] [-c CONTENT]
